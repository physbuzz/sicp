# SICP Chapter 3.2 Exercises

#### Exercise 3.9

In 1.2.1 we used the
substitution model to analyze two procedures for computing factorials, a
recursive version

```rkt
(define (factorial n)
  (if (= n 1)
      1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
```


and an iterative version

```rkt
(define (factorial n)
  (fact-iter 1 1 n))

(define (fact-iter product 
                   counter 
                   max-count)
  (if (> counter max-count)
      product
      (fact-iter (* counter product)
                 (+ counter 1)
                 max-count)))
```

Show the environment structures created by evaluating `(factorial 6)`
using each version of the `factorial` procedure.

#### Exercise 3.10

In the `make-withdraw`
procedure, the local variable `balance` is created as a parameter of
`make-withdraw`.  We could also create the local state variable
explicitly, using `let`, as follows:

```rkt
(define (make-withdraw initial-amount)
  (let ((balance initial-amount))
    (lambda (amount)
      (if (>= balance amount)
          (begin (set! balance 
                       (- balance amount))
                 balance)
          "Insufficient funds"))))
```

Recall from 1.3.2 that `let` is simply syntactic sugar for a
procedure call:

```rkt
(let ((⟨@var{var}⟩ ⟨@var{exp}⟩)) ⟨@var{body}⟩)
```


is interpreted as an alternate syntax for

```rkt
((lambda (⟨@var{var}⟩) ⟨@var{body}⟩) ⟨@var{exp}⟩)
```

Use the environment model to analyze this alternate version of
`make-withdraw`, drawing figures like the ones above to illustrate the
interactions

```rkt
(define W1 (make-withdraw 100))
(W1 50)
(define W2 (make-withdraw 100))
```

Show that the two versions of `make-withdraw` create objects with the same
behavior.  How do the environment structures differ for the two versions?

#### Exercise 3.11

In 3.2.3 we saw how
the environment model described the behavior of procedures with local state.
Now we have seen how internal definitions work.  A typical message-passing
procedure contains both of these aspects.  Consider the bank account procedure
of 3.1.1:

```rkt
(define (make-account balance)
  (define (withdraw amount)
    (if (>= balance amount)
        (begin (set! balance 
                     (- balance 
                        amount))
               balance)
        "Insufficient funds"))
  (define (deposit amount)
    (set! balance (+ balance amount))
    balance)
  (define (dispatch m)
    (cond ((eq? m 'withdraw) withdraw)
          ((eq? m 'deposit) deposit)
          (else (error "Unknown request: 
                        MAKE-ACCOUNT" 
                       m))))
  dispatch)
```

Show the environment structure generated by the sequence of interactions

```rkt
(define acc (make-account 50))

((acc 'deposit) 40)
90

((acc 'withdraw) 60)
30
```

Where is the local state for `acc` kept?  Suppose we define another
account

```rkt
(define acc2 (make-account 100))
```

How are the local states for the two accounts kept distinct?  Which parts of
the environment structure are shared between `acc` and `acc2`?
