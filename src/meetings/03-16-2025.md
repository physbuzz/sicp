## March 16 2025 Notes
- There was some mention of "recursive processes vs. recursive procedures". To me I didn't read it as emphasizing process vs procedure, I read it as emphasizing that a recursive procedure was one thing, but talking about something that's linear recursive is a statement about its big-O (or rather big Theta).
- It was mentioned that oftentimes big O is more important and easier to prove. I personally really like algorithms where big O fails to capture the interesting aspects of the algorithm. For example:
   - IIRC SAT solvers all have worst case exponential running time (need to fact check this), but you can still write very interesting very fast SAT solver algorithms.
   - Worst case running time might be infinite. ie writing a program to prove that a class of programs halts: can't be done in general, but there's still interesting things to do. 
   - Worst case is bad, but the constant can be pushed down so low that it doesn't matter. You know, if something requires $c 2^n$ operations but $c=10^{-9},$ then we still have a useful (and quite fast) algorithm for small $n$.

## For next time
Read section 1.3

I'll try to do all the practice problems. No worries if someone doesn't do em.
