### Meeting Notes
- I overlooked the definition of a "combination" 
- The operator in a combination is also an expression which has to be evaluated
- "Short circuit evaluation" of special forms, this becomes the basis of macros later on!
- "Symbols" and "function composition" have specific meanings that will be referred to later
- "Lisp form" has a technical meaning, but for this chapter we've just defined "special form". 
- [Curry–Howard correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence) mentioned.
- `let` (Discussed later in the book) is very similar to scoped defines. It works a little differently, but it does work with lexical scoping.
- [Combinators and the story of computation](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/combinators-and-the-story-of-computation/) - now's the time to read this!

### For next time
- Finish 1.2
