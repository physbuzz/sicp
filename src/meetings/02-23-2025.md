### Introductory Notes
- Recommended to use the [Racket IDE](https://www.racket-lang.org/) which has an SICP package. [Racket docs](https://docs.racket-lang.org/)
- "It's R4RS Scheme with some oddball features"
- Start programs in Racket with `#lang sicp` ([instructions for installing sicp package](https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/Installation.html)).
- We can compare practice problem solutions, we'll probably just discuss this over Discord or text rather than organizing anything in particular.
- The secret to handling parentheses in lisp: Use an editor, you don't have to do it manually!
- parinfer https://shaunlebron.github.io/parinfer/ is great
- Fun note: KICAD uses S-expressions as a file format

### Discussion
- Late in chapter 3, they introduce a better execution model
- By having a mutable environment, you invalidate the substitution model.

### For next time:
- Do section 1.1, it's probably enough material to discuss
- We can discuss up to section 1.2, depending on how far we get
