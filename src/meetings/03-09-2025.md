## Meeting March 9, 2025
*No official meeting today, this was just a problem session.*

We spent a lot of time on exercise 1.14. 

- Note: Try integer exponentiation via repeated squaring -> Overshoot and divide.
- Somewhere it came up that because this is a particularly simple programming language, how about using C macros to implement LISP? Lol.
- 1.14, it's easier to think think about if we had coin sizes of 64, 32, 16, ... Maybe not relevant but it's a cool thing to consider anyways.
