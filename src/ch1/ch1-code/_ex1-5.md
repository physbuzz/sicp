I'd argue that this isn't a very good question... basically what we're saying is that normal ordering's "fully expand then reduce" doesn't apply to the if statement. So using normal order evaluation, we expand partway (but we don't expand `(p)`) but upon evaluating 
`(if (= 0 0) 0 (p))` our reduce step is smart enough to only evaluate `0`. So the expression returns 0.

Using applicative order evaluation, we first evaluate both arguments. `0` evaluates to `0`, but evaluating `(p)` triggers our bomb and we expect an implementation of applicative order evaluation to crash.
